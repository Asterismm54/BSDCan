*BSDCan About*

**What is BSDCan?**

BSDCan is an annual conference dedicated to all flavours of the Berkeley Software Distribution. 
It is held at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, Canada each year and quickly established itself as the technical conference 
for people working on and with 4.4BSD based operating systems and related projects. The organizers have found a fantastic formula 
that appeals to a wide range of people from novices to advanced developers.
